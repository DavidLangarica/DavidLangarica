#Hy, I'm David Langarica!

I am a Mexican, born and raised in Irapuato, Guanajuato. Recently I moved to Querétaro, and here, I'm studying Computer Science Engineering in Tecnológico de Monterrey
and pursuing the UX Design certification by Google Careers.

Both design and technology have always been a fundamental part of my life. When I was little, you could find me either drawing something or experimenting with the
computer, which would then evolve practically the same, the difference is that now I am becoming a pro at it, as well as I am able to mark a real change with those
abilities.

I am passionate about finding out-of-the-ordinary solutions and always aim to try new things while learning both from them and from the people who accompany me along
the way.

In my spare time, you will find me with my headphones on, listening to some EDM tunes and learning a new skill or getting better in the ones I already have.
